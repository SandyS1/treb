The /config/ directory should specifically hold one file, config.xml, which is parsed by the framework in order to store various configuration options for you.  The reason for a whole directory for this, is under the assumption that you will end up with multiple configuration files (live, test, preview, etc), that you will want to keep track of separately, and that get copied to 'config.xml' as appropriate.
